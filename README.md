# Bike Sharing Assignment
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. It is required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- Bike Sharing demand prediction using Linear Regression model.
- Manipulate the business strategy using the prediction to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
- Dataset day.csv which has different dependent and independent variables is being used for demand prediction of bikes.


## Conclusions
- Clear weather has more positive impact towards cnt
- Day of the week has very minimal variations across the 7 days
- cnt gradually increases as calendar month increases and after mid year seems to be reduction in cnt
- year on year increase between 2018 and 2019 is increasing trend
- Spring has the lowes demand for cnt and Fall has the highest demand
- Working day and holiday has very minimal variations
- Based on the final model, top 3 features contributing significantly towards explaining the demand of the shared bikes are temperature, Weather Light Rain and Snow, year.
